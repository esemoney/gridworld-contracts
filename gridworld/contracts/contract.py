'''
gridworld/contracts/contract.py

This contains the Contract class to manage contract interactions 
between agents.

The key responsibilities are:

- Handling contract proposals and acceptances
  - Define propose_contract() and accept_contract() methods

- Implementing state-based rules for rewards/token transfers
  - Transfer tokens on acceptance based on predefined rules
  - This simulates a smart contract action for the MVP

- Tracking contract state over time
  - Keep track of contract terms, acceptance status, etc.

By modularizing the contract logic we make it easy to test the impact
of adding contracts in the gridworld environment.
